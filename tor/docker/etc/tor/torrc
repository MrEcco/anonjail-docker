########################### Chain ############################
ClientOnly 1
ConnectionPadding auto

### A list of identity fingerprints, country codes, and address
### patterns of nodes to avoid when building a circuit. Country codes
### are 2-letter ISO3166 codes, and must be wrapped in braces;
### fingerprints may be preceded by a dollar sign.
### (Example: ExcludeNodes ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234CDEF5678ABCD1234, {cc}, 255.254.0.0/8)
###
### Country codes are case-insensitive. The code "{??}" refers to
### nodes whose country can’t be identified. No country code,
### including {??}, works if no GeoIPFile can be loaded. See also the
### GeoIPExcludeUnknown option below.
#ExcludeNodes node,node,…

########################## Proxying ##########################

### Tor will make all its directory requests through this host:port
### (or host:80 if port is not specified), rather than connecting
### directly to any directory servers.
### (DEPRECATED: As of 0.3.1.0-alpha you should use HTTPSProxy.)
#HTTPProxy host[:port]

### If defined, Tor will use this username:password for Basic HTTP
### proxy authentication, as in RFC 2617. This is currently the only
### form of HTTP proxy authentication that Tor supports; feel free
### to submit a patch if you want it to support others.
### (DEPRECATED: As of 0.3.1.0-alpha you should use
### HTTPSProxyAuthenticator.)
#HTTPProxyAuthenticator username:password

### Tor will make all its OR (SSL) connections through this host:port
### (or host:443 if port is not specified), via HTTP CONNECT rather
### than connecting directly to servers. You may want to set
### FascistFirewall to restrict the set of ports you might try to
### connect to, if your HTTPS proxy only allows connecting to
### certain ports.
#HTTPSProxy host[:port]

### If defined, Tor will use this username:password for Basic HTTPS
### proxy authentication, as in RFC 2617. This is currently the only
### form of HTTPS proxy authentication that Tor supports; feel free
### to submit a patch if you want it to support others.
#HTTPSProxyAuthenticator username:password

### Tor will make all OR connections through the SOCKS 5 proxy at
### host:port (or host:1080 if port is not specified).
#Socks5Proxy host[:port]
#Socks5ProxyUsername username
#Socks5ProxyPassword password

########################## Bridges ###########################
### When set, Tor will fetch descriptors for each bridge listed in the
### "Bridge" config lines, and use these relays as both entry guards
### and directory guards. (Default: 0)
#UseBridges 1

### When set along with UseBridges, instructs Tor to use the relay
### at "IP:ORPort" as a "bridge" relaying into the Tor network. If
### "fingerprint" is provided (using the same format as for
### DirAuthority), we will verify that the relay running at that
### location has the right fingerprint. We also use fingerprint to
### look up the bridge descriptor at the bridge authority, if it’s
### provided and if UpdateBridgesFromAuthority is set too.
###
### If "transport" is provided, it must match a ClientTransportPlugin
### line. We then use that pluggable transport’s proxy to transfer
### data to the bridge, rather than connecting to the bridge directly.
### Some transports use a transport-specific method to work out the
### remote address to connect to. These transports typically ignore
### the "IP:ORPort" specified in the bridge line.
###
### Tor passes any "key=val" settings to the pluggable transport proxy
### as per-connection arguments when connecting to the bridge. Consult
### the documentation of the pluggable transport for details of what
### arguments it supports.
